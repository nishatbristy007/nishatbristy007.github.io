I am a third year PhD student in [School of Computer Science](https://cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am advised by [Dr. Russell Schwartz](https://cbd.cmu.edu/people/schwartz.html). My research interests broadly lie in the area of -


<blockquote>
  <ul>
      <li> Machine Learning for Health</li>
      <li> Tumor Phylogeny</li> 
      <li> Algorithms</li>
      <li> Bulk and Single-cell multi-omics</li>  
      <li> Discrete and Continuous Optimization Problems</li>
  </ul>

I have completed my undergraduate studies in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/) from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/), where I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Md. Shamsuzzoha Bayzid](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty/faculty_detail/bayzid) on alignment-based and alignment-free phylogenetic distance estimation. 

Apart from work, I am enthusiastic about swimming and reading.
