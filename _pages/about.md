I am a third year PhD student in the Ray and Stephanie Lane Computational Biology Department at Carnegie Mellon University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Russell Schwartz](https://labs.bio.cmu.edu/schwartz/). I am broadly interested in -

<ul>
    <li style="color: red;">Developing novel and scalable algorithms to understand tumor progression from multi-omic datasets.</li>
    <li style="color: green;">Identifying structural and functional relationships among DNA and RNA sequences.</li>
</ul>


I have completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, where I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Md. Shamsuzzoha Bayzid](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty/faculty_detail/bayzid). 

Outside work, I enjoy reading and swimming.
