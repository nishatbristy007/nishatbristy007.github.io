I am a third year PhD student in the Ray and Stephanie Lane Computational Biology Department at Carnegie Mellon University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Russell Schwartz](https://labs.bio.cmu.edu/schwartz/). I am broadly interested in -

<ul class="my-bullet-list">
    <li> Developing novel and scalable algorithms to understand tumor progression and biomarker discovery.</li>
    <li> Understanding structural and functional relationships among DNA and RNA sequences.</li>
   
</ul>

I have completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, where I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Md. Shamsuzzoha Bayzid](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty/faculty_detail/bayzid). 

Apart from work, I am enthusiastic about swimming and reading.
