I am a third year PhD student in the [Ray and Stephanie Lane Computational Biology Department](https://cbd.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Russell Schwartz](https://labs.bio.cmu.edu/schwartz/). My research interests broadly lie in the are of

I have completed my undergraduate studies in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/) from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology](buet.ac.bd), where I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Md. Shamsuzzoha Bayzid](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty/faculty_detail/bayzid). 

Apart from work, I am enthusiastic about swimming and reading.
